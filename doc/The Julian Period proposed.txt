(22:4) Then let us devise a period, which contains each cycle and the Indiction: what happens if we multiply by the period of Dionysius Exiguus by fifteen: we get a period of 7980 years. (7) This period will start from the first year of each cycle and of the Indiction: and similarly the end of each cycle and the Indiction defines the end of the period. (9) But the Christian year, which is in common use, is 3267 years less than the last year of the cycles and the Indiction. (10) So we substract 3267 from 7980 years to get the epoch of the common Christian year, being 4713. (12) Thus year one in the common Christian count is year 4714 in the period, year 10 in the solar cycle, year 2 in the lunar cycle, year 4 in the Indiction, on the first of Januari: Although the Indiction starts in the preceding autumn, and the next lunar cycle starts in the following March. (15) Therefore the current year, which erroniously purports to be 1594, is year 6307 in the period.

We will call this period the Julian Period, because it accomodates the form of the Julian year.

(17) By dividing 6307 by the length of each cycle, we get as remainder the year in each cycle of the current year 6307 in the Julian Period, or the common Christian year 1594 . Dividing by 28 we get year 7 in the solar cycle on the first of Januari. (19) Dividing by 19 we get year 18 in the lunar cycle, starting the following March. (20) Dividing by 15 we get year 7 in the Ceasarian Indiction, which starts on the "ante d. VIII Kal. Octobris" (24th of September) in the preceding year 6306.

Original Kepler Fonts demo text:\\
Where Fractions are wanting, a Division serves to distinguish the
Numerator from the Denominator, by putting it thus; viz.\ 3-8, 12-63, 
16-50, though some other symbol might serve better for the purpose; and
therefore we propose one that is similar to an Italic~\textit{l}
inverted, and whose figure takes in the whole depth of its body.
Quite an achievement, don't you think?
